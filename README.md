# CS_2025_project

## Description
My project is heavily inspired by videos of different chess grandmasters playing chess blindfolded. The idea is extremely simple. User chooses amount of pieces on the board, and he is given the position to remember. After certain amount of time user needs to recreate the position by placing pieces onto the board. After that website shows pieces user got wrong. There are also some extensions that can be implemented, for example, giving user ability to determine the best move in the position. Reseach suggests that practicing blindfold chess improves sighted chess skill.(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2972788/#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20strongest%20masters,chess%20improves%20sighted%20chess%20skill.)
